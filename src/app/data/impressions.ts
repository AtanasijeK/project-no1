      "I have been seeing Dr Angus Phelps since 2021. Initially it was to help with my posture. After a few adjustments I noticed a significant improvement and I’ve continued with maintenance adjustments. When providing treatment I found Dr Angus to be very professional, knowledgeable and caring. He listens carefully to understand what the issue is and provides treatment accordingly. I feel confident in his care and I would highly recommend him and the whole team.",
